# Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration

## What Was Fixed

Your application was experiencing Content Security Policy (CSP) errors that blocked:
1. Firebase Authentication API connections (`identitytoolkit.googleapis.com`)
2. Script loading from various domains needed by Firebase

## Comprehensive Solution

I've implemented a three-layer CSP protection strategy that allows all necessary Firebase and Google services while maintaining security:

### 1. `netlify.toml` Configuration
The main CSP header is set in the Netlify configuration file with comprehensive permissions.

### 2. `public/_headers` Fallback
A duplicate of the CSP is in Netlify's `_headers` file as a backup implementation.

### 3. HTML Meta Tag
A final HTML-level CSP is applied directly in `index.html` to ensure it works even if HTTP headers are modified.

## Key CSP Directives Added

- `script-src-elem`: Explicit permissions for script elements (addressing the error you saw)
- Additional domains for Firebase services
- Support for CloudinaryAPIs
- `blob:` support for image uploads and processing
- Support for Google Fonts

## Testing Your Application

After deploying these changes to Netlify:

1. Clear your browser cache completely
2. Try logging in again
3. If using browser extensions like AdGuard, consider temporarily disabling them while testing

## If Problems Persist

If you encounter additional CSP errors:

1. Check the browser console for the specific blocked URL
2. Add that domain to all three CSP configurations
3. Redeploy

## Browser Extensions Impact

Ad blockers and privacy extensions (like AdGuard mentioned in your error) may inject their own CSP rules. The HTML meta tag helps mitigate this, but users with strict extensions may need to whitelist your site.
